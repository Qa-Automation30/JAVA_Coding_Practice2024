     * Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor.
     *
     * Constructor chaining can be done in two ways:
     *
     * Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors in the same class
     * From base class: by using super() keyword to call the constructor from the base class.
     * =========================
     *
     * Constructor chaining occurs through inheritance.
     * A sub-class constructor’s task is to call super class’s constructor first.
     * This ensures that the creation of sub class’s object starts with the initialization of the data members of the superclass.
     *
