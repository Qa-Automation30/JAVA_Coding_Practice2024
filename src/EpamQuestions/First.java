     * Question: Find and Print Array Leaders
     *
     * You are given an array of integers,
     * num. An element of this array is considered a "leader"
     * if it is greater than all the elements to its right in the array. You need to write a Java program to
     * find and print all the leaders in the array.
     *
     * Here's an example to illustrate:
     *
     * Consider the array:  int[] num = {14, 9, 11, 7, 8, 5, 3};
     * Your task is to write a Java program that takes an integer array num as input and prints all the leaders in the array.
