/**
 * Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array.
 * An element of array is a leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side.
 * The rightmost element is always a leader.
 * 
 *   Input:
 * n = 6
 * A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}
 * Output: 17 5 2
 * Explanation: The first leader is 17
 * as it is greater than all the elements
 * to its right.  Similarly, the next
 * leader is 5. The right most element
 * is always a leader so it is also
 * included.
 *
 * Input:
 * n = 5
 * A[] = {1,2,3,4,0}
 * Output: 4 0
 * Explanation: 0 is the rightmost element
 * and 4 is the only element which is greater
 * than all the elements to its right.
